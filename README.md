## Graph
A graph (sometimes called undirected graph for distinguishing from a directed 
graph, or simple graph for distinguishing from a multigraph)
is a pair G = (V, E), where V is a set whose elements are called vertices 
(singular: [Vertex]()), and E is a set of two-sets 
(sets with two distinct elements) of vertices, 
whose elements are called [Edge]()s (sometimes links or lines).

## Directed Graph
A directed graph or digraph is a graph in which edges have orientations.

In one restricted but very common sense of the term, a directed graph 
is an ordered pair G = (V, E) comprising:
* V a set of vertices (also called nodes or points);
* E ⊆ {(x, y) | (x, y) ∈ V2 ∧ x ≠ y} a set of edges (also called directed edges, 
directed links, directed lines, arrows or [Arcs]()) which are ordered pairs of 
distinct vertices (i.e., an edge is associated with two distinct vertices).
